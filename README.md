# Exploring-Covid-19-data-set-using-SQL-server-management-studio

Lets drill down on the Covid 19 data set and extract useful business insights from the data.

Description of data set

> There are two data sets like Covid deaths and Covid Vaccinations. Covid death data set contains about 85,172 records and Covid Vaccination data set contains about 85,170 records.

Data Analysis by SQL and Excel

> Leveraged Excel to perform the cleaning of the data set, and make the data more readable for further analysis.

> Crafted SQL queries to perform aggregation and join functions to extract meaningful insights from the data set. 

> Loaded and visualized the covid 19 data using Tableau, here is link to my Covid 19 dashbaord using Tableau, https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/govind.krishnadas/viz/Covid19Dashboard_16899457592300/Dashboard1.

All Sql queries I used for analysing this covid 19 data set are in the folder named SQL Queries crafted.


The key skills I learned in this project is creating temp tables, using joins to extract data from multiple tables, perfom aggregations functions, changing data types.
